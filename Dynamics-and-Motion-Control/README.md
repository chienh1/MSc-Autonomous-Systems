# Dynamics and Motion Control

## Course Overview
This directory contains materials for the MF2007 HT24 Dynamics and Motion Control course offered at KTH, 2024. This course focuses on the design, modeling, and prototyping of control systems for mechatronic applications, aiming to achieve precise motion trajectories. It integrates foundational knowledge from related fields such as mechanics, mathematics, and engineering. Participants will learn to develop, implement, and analyze mechatronic control systems using software tools.

## Content
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Exercises**
  - Modelling
  - Actuators and Sensors
  - Controller Design

- **Workshops**
  - Rapid Control Prototyping: Hands-on sessions using Texas Instruments C2000 processors and DC motors to implement control solutions rapidly.

## Course Status
The course is currently ongoing. Detailed reports and additional resources will be uploaded upon completion of the course.
