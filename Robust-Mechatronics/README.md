# Lab Work for Robust Mechatronics

## Description
This directoy contains the files for the labs in the MF2043 HT24 Robust Mechatronics course at KTH, including schematics, board layouts, and Arduino code. In the labs, we designed, simulated and verified circuits used for 

## Labs Overview

### Lab 1: Motor Control Using PWM
Explores driving actuators with PWM, focusing on circuit techniques like bootstrapping for efficient motor control and includes mechanisms for safe current dissipation.

### Lab 2: Amplifier and Analog Filters Design
Involves building and testing amplifier circuits to understand the effects of component values on filter selectivity and gain.

### Lab 3: Active Filtering and Signal Sampling
Combines active filtering with analog signal sampling, integrating signal processing and visualization to enhance troubleshooting and filter optimization.
